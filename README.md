# Execution
To run the code, you need to execute:
``` 
python main.py
``` 

# Assumptions
Given the description of the tasks. I assumed that the fights were 1 vs 1. For the simplicity of the problem, they will fight in turns. Starting the hero with grater speed. In case both have the same speed, it's randomly selected.

- When the fight ends, the winner recovers its health and It's able to fight again.

- When some stat was null, it is equivalent to 0.

- the recalculation of stats it is done before the calculation of HP

- In case of neutral heroes, causing a tie at the moment of defining the alignment of the team, i say that the good heroes will convince the neutral to be a good team.
